# += -= *= /= //=
# first, an add operation.
# Next,the assignment of the result of an add operation.
# i=2;        	#initializing i to 2
# i+=2;		#equals to, i = i+2;
# Statement i+=2 is equal to i=i+2, hence 2 will be added to the value of i, which gives us 4.
# Finally, the result of addition, 4 is assigned back to i, updating its original value from 2 to 4.
